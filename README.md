#### 1. Operating Profit Performance
The operating profit data across different retailers and regions in 2020 and 2021 reveals important trends that highlight the financial health and operational effectiveness of Adidas in various markets. Key observations include:

- **Midwest Region**: Foot Locker demonstrated a remarkable increase in operating profit from **$652,862.50** in 2020 to **$22,512,787.50** in 2021. This significant growth indicates that Foot Locker's sales strategies and operational efficiencies have resonated well with customers in this region, leading to higher profitability.

- **Northeast Region**: In the Northeast, the operating profit for Foot Locker rose from **$1,323,375.00** to **$41,220,825.00**, showcasing an impressive performance. Walmart and Amazon also showed substantial profitability, indicating effective market penetration and consumer engagement.

- **South Region**: The South displays variability in operating profit, especially for Sports Direct, which recorded a notable profit of **$1,864,598.87** in 2021. This indicates that despite the challenges, some retailers have managed to maintain healthy profit margins, reflecting strategic product placement and marketing efforts.

- **Southeast Region**: The Southeast region shows a dynamic profit landscape, particularly with Foot Locker's operating profit rising from **$11,765,812.50** in 2020 to **$13,816,750.00** in 2021. The presence of significant profits from both online and outlet sales illustrates a robust operational strategy that capitalizes on diverse sales channels.

#### 2. Retailer Comparison Based on Operating Profit
The analysis of operating profit among different retailers reveals competitive strengths and areas for improvement:

- **Amazon**: With strong operating profit figures across regions, Amazon's model shows resilience in the face of market fluctuations. The transition to e-commerce has paid off, leading to increased operational profitability.

- **Walmart**: Walmart's operating profits suggest that its traditional retail model, combined with a growing online presence, remains competitive. The profits indicate effective cost management and a strong supply chain, which are essential for maintaining profitability.

- **Foot Locker**: The substantial growth in Foot Locker's operating profit suggests that the retailer has effectively capitalized on marketing campaigns or exclusive product launches. This performance indicates that Adidas's partnership with Foot Locker is yielding significant financial benefits.

- **Kohlâ€™s**: The lack of reported operating profit in certain regions indicates potential challenges that may be affecting Kohl's ability to compete. Understanding the causes behind these gaps could guide strategic adjustments to enhance profitability.

#### 3. Data Gaps and Their Implications
The presence of NaN values in the operating profit data indicates potential issues:

- **Missing Data Points**: These gaps might signify that certain retailers did not report sales data or had no operational presence for Adidas products in specific regions. For instance, the absence of data for Kohlâ€™s in certain areas raises questions about its sales strategy.

- **Impact on Profit Analysis**: Addressing these missing values is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of operating profit trends. Gaps can obscure the full financial picture, making it difficult to gauge overall profitability accurately. Efforts should be made to gather complete data to facilitate a clearer analysis of performance across all channels.

### Conclusion
The analysis of operating profit across different retailers and regions provides critical insights into Adidas's financial performance. Understanding these dynamics allows Adidas to refine its operational strategies, enhance retailer partnerships, and adapt its marketing efforts to better align with consumer preferences. By continuously monitoring these metrics, Adidas can identify opportunities for growth and areas needing strategic intervention, ensuring sustained profitability in an evolving market landscape.
